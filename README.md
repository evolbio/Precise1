The "entropy" branch adds code to test the variability among replicates for a given set of parameters.

Further changes starting with commit f0b2bb add additional figures to the manuscript and upgrade to Julia 1.9 from 1.8. If you have difficulty running some of the code, try reverting to an earlier commit that associates with 1.8 and instantiate your Julia system accordingly.

Newest version a05530d associated with updated bioRxiv manuscript, two new figures, several updates in analysis and explanations of results.
