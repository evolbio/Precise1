The "entropy" branch adds code to test the variability among replicates for a given set of parameters with respect to Figure 2 of the manuscript. 

Further changes starting with commit f0b2bb add additional figures to the manuscript and upgrade to Julia 1.9 from 1.8. If you have difficulty running some of the code, try reverting to an earlier commit that associates with 1.8 and instantiate your Julia system accordingly.
